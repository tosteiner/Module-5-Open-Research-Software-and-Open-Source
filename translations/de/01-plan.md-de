## Module 5: Initiate and plan

### Define the target groups

- Computational researchers
- Graduate and undergraduate students
- Data scientists
- Any other researcher who uses analytical code/software

### Refine the learning objectives and outcomes

- The learner will be able to define the characteristics of open source research software, and the ethical, legal, economic and research impact arguments for and against it.
- Based on community standards, learners will be able to describe the quality requirements of sharing and re-using open code.
- The learner will be able to use a range of research tools that utilise open source software.
- Individual learners will be able to transform code designed for their personal use into code that is accessible and re-usable by others.

### Design the course outline

1. What is Open Source Software, including background and examples.
2. Principles of Open Source Software.
3. What open, collaborative platforms, with version control, exist.
4. Why should code be shared as a research output.
5. How to use GitHub combined with the Zenodo plug-in for code archiving.
6. How to document and publish code, and what makes good software for re-use, including testing and comments.
7. Open Source licensing.
8. Tools for better open research
9. Community codes, governance, and contributions.
10. How to access and start working on general computing platforms
11. Software citation.
12. Differences in setting up accounts/storage/computing on different platforms.
13. Comparison in terms of collaboration and openness with clusters/in-house servers.
14. Where can you go from here? Includes an introduction to the Open Source community and further resources for learning.
